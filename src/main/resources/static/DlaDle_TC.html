TERMS & CONDITIONS</p><p>DLADLE offers a mobile application for consumers (hereafter referred to as “The Application”) that is owned by AGKA Holdings (Pty) Ltd (hereafter known as “The Company”). The Application is available through Apple and Android application stores for download. The purpose of the The Application is to allow consumers (hereafter referred to as “users”) to view content to aid with rental dispute resolution, to engage with other users, and to engage with local service providers (hereafter referred to as “vendors”) by making use of the user’s and/or the vendor’s current location(s) (determined by GPS coordinates).</p><p>2.       LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</p><p>The Application is used at the sole discretion of the users and vendors. The purpose of The Application is solely to aid in the maintenance of the rental relationship between landlords and tenants, and to connect users and vendors through The Application’s features and facilities. The Application and/or The Company may therefore not be held liable for any loss, injury and/or death caused by any user(s) and/or vendor(s) of The Application to any person as a result of using The Application.</p><p>3.       PAYMENT TERMS</p><p>         i.            The Application is downloaded and a profile is registered at the user’s own discretion. Any payment made with regards to the download of The Application and/or any payments made through The Application are not refundable.</p><p>   	ii.            The Company and The Application may also not be held liable for any of the vendor’s service delivery, workmanship or product quality. Payment refunds and returns agreed upon from the vendor with a said user may only be facilitated and arranged upon out of The Application.</p><p> 	iii.            The Application makes no recommendations regarding fees or charges. The User shall pay the vendor the fees as advertised on The Application by them.</p><p> 	iv.            The user mandates The Application to accept payment of the fees from the user on behalf of the vendor and then make payment on behalf of the user to the vendor</p><p>   	v.            The vendor shall pay The Application a booking fee</p><p> 	vi.            The Application shall release the fees, less the booking fee, to the vendor on a scheduled basis for every completed job/shift.</p><p>	vii.            Users will remain liable for the fees for any booking cancelled by the user where the user gave the vendor less than 3 hours prior notice</p><p>  viii.

Failure to comply with this provision may result in the users profile being removed from The Application</p><p>   	ii.            In the event that the user fails to comply with his/her obligations in terms of this agreement or at law, then, without prejudice to The Company’s rights and remedies at law or in terms of the agreement (including its right to terminate this agreement and remove the profile), The Company will be entitled to claim and the user will be liable for all losses, damages and costs suffered or incurred by The Application as a result thereof.</p><p> 	iii.            The user hereby agrees to adhere to generally acceptable internet and email etiquette.</p><p> 	iv.            The vendor is not in any way affiliated with The Application. In other words, the vendor is not an employee, representative, agent or contractor of The Application and/or The Company. The Application and/or Company shall in no way, manner or form be regarded as a temporary employment service provider. It is therefore the users sole responsibility to agree to the terms of the services (including but not limited to, what services will be provided, working hours and fees) with the vendor and to enter into an appropriate agreement with the vendor.
