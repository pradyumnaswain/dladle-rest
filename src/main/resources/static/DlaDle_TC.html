The purpose of The    Application is solely to aid in the maintenance of the rental relationship between landlords and tenants, and to    connect users and vendors through The Application’s features and facilities. The Application and/or The Company may    therefore not be held liable for any loss, injury and/or death caused by any user(s) and/or vendor(s) of The    Application to any person as a result of using The Application.</p><div style="text-align: center;"><h3 style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;color:blue">PAYMENT TERMS </h3></div><ul style="list-style-type:square;text-align:justify">    <li>The Application is downloaded and a profile is registered at the user’s own discretion.
